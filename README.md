# Portrait AI

Portrait AI is a simple AI project that generates human portraits based on input prompts. This project uses Gradio to create an easy-to-use interface for the AI model.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Gradio 4.29.0

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the App
To run the app, simply execute the app.py file:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start a local server and open the Gradio interface in your default web browser.

### How to Use
Enter your prompt in the input field and click on the 'Submit' button. The AI will then generate a human portrait based on your prompt.
